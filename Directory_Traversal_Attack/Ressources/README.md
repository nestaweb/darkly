# Directory Traversal Attack

## Description
A directory traversal attack exploits insufficient input validation in a web application. By injecting special character sequences like `../` (dot-dot-slash), the attacker can navigate up the directory hierarchy on the serverâ€™s file system.

This allows access to files and directories outside the intended scope of the application, such as configuration files, source code, or sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd` on Linux systems.

## BornToSec
First, I noticed that the website was vulnerable to directory traversal. I navigated to the following URL:
```http
http://10.11.249.222/index.php?page=../../
```

And I got a different error than the usual "Wtf ?".
So continue to add a lot of `../` until I understood that the fact that i could navigate through the directories could expose some very sensitive files as the famous one `/etc/passwd`.

Then I navigated to the following URL:
```http
http://10.11.249.222/index.php?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

And I got the flag.

## How to prevent it
- Validate and Sanitize Input: Ensure that user-supplied input is strictly validated. Reject inputs containing `../`, `/`, or similar patterns.
- Use Allow Lists: Restrict file access to a predefined list of safe and expected files.
- Canonicalize Paths: Use functions like `realpath()` (in PHP) or equivalent in other languages to resolve and verify file paths against an allowed base directory.
- Restrict File Permissions: Limit access to sensitive files and directories using proper file system permissions.
- Use Built-in Security Features: Many frameworks provide secure methods for handling file paths that automatically prevent traversal attacks.
